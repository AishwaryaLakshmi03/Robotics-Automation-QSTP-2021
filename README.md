# Robotics-Automation-QSTP-2021
Automation and Control in Robotics is a fast growing field with exciting innovations
coming out with a rapid pace. In this course we hope to familiarise
you with the basic tools and techniques that are at the core of such developments.


The course begins from scratch by covering the basics of Python including branching,
looping, basic I/O and functions. The key tool you will be learning in the course is the
Robotics Operating System (ROS) - a software framework designed to make robotics
development easier. Along with this you will also be working with Gazebo which is a
robotics simulator where you can create your own robot models or even test out code
on pre-existing Turtlebot.


The final project is programming an autonomous ground robot, this will involve
combining the tasks you will do over the course of the 6 weeks. You will be given a
map of an environment with some obstacles. Your task is to help an intelligent robotic
spy to spy on an alleged criminal. You will program the robot to follow the suspect in a
bounded unknown environment with obstacles. The robot must also avoid the
obstacles as it tries to follow the target. The constraint is to stay close to the target but
not too close to avoid getting caught. You will be using one of the path planning
algorithms you will have learned. You will then need to write a controller for the turtlebot
to traverse the path and follow the suspect.
