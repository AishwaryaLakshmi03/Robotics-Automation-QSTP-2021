# Robotics-Automation-QSTP-2021
Automation and Control in Robotics is a fast growing field with exciting innovations
coming out with a rapid pace. The Project is about programming an autonomous ground robot, this will involve
combining the tasks that we have done over the course of the 6 weeks. A
map of an environment with some obstacles is given. Our task is to help an intelligent robotic
spy to spy on an alleged criminal. We are going to program the robot to follow the suspect in a
bounded unknown environment with obstacles. The robot is also set to avoid the
obstacles as it tries to follow the target. The constraint is to stay close to the target but
not too close to avoid getting caught. We will be using one of the path planning
algorithms and write a controller for the turtlebot to traverse the path and follow the suspect.
